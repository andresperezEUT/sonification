Position in km from earth (gse coordinates xyz), field in nT (nanoTesla)
Time in fraction of days relative to given start day (*86400 to get seconds)
Data was divided by scaling factors to get into the range of +-1. for wav
Time [sec] = value * timescale * 86400
Data [nT]  = value * fieldscale
Position [km] in xyz = value * positionscale
Start day ymd:  20071027
Time scale:     2.000000
Field scale:    200.000000
Position scale: 200000.000000
