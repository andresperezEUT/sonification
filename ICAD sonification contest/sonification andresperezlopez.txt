MAGNETIC SPACE

------------------------------------
MAGNETIC SPACE is an artistic approximation to the Cluster magnetic data.
The sonification is entirely produced in SuperCollider, with a small post-processing with Ardour.

The most predominant sound comes from the magnetic data. 
The absolute value of measured magnetic field, as well as its first derivative, is mapped to the dusty, wind-like sound, which resembles the solar wind. 

There is a second, blip-type sound. 
Extrapolating the concept of the observer's importance and implication in the measurement, the sound informs about the position of the four satellits, by locating a satellites' sound representation in the virtual acoustic space. 
The x-axis is arbitrarily chosen to be in the front of the listener, and z-axis is vertical positive direction.
The sound is actually produced for binaural listening (Cipic subject number 65), but stereo-panning will probably also work. 
Spatialization is provided by 3Dj, the live sound spatialization framework I'm presenting at the conference (http://github.com/andresperezlopez/3Dj).
